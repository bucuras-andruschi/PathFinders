## Introduction

Pathfinder is an Arduino Uno-based robot vehicle that has been made for the WRO Future Engineers competition. This documentation provides a thorough overview of its components, design, and the code that drives its performance. The robot utilizes some advanced features such as ultrasonic sensors and a Pixy camera for accurate obstacle detection and color recognition. This document serves as a guide for those interested in understanding and replicating our robot's functionality.

## About Us


Pathfinders consists of three hard-working students, with each member adding essential skills to the project. Andrei, the skilled coder, ensures the robot's software runs smoothly. Darius, the expert builder, is key to bringing the design to life, making sure it is strong and functional. Alex, the diligent documenter and co-coder, connects the concept to reality by carefully recording our progress and helping with creating codes. Even though we are very young, our team shows great dedication and a variety of skills, promising a project that combines accurate coding, sturdy construction, and detailed documentation for the WRO Future Engineers competition.
